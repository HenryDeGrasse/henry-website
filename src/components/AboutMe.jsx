                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Henry DeGrasse, currently working a Software Engineering Co-op at Chewy. I am also a
                    student at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a
                    minor in Mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My area of expertise lies in Software Engineering and Development, but I am fascinated by the
                    relationship between mathematics and it's application to our daily lives, especially in Economics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding and algorithms, you can find me engaging in my set of hobbies. Whether it's
                    lacing up for a run, pen-to-paper doodling, training in MMA, or immersing myself in a good book,
                    these activities are my way of staying and feeling healthy and balanced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to improve my life and the lives of those
                    around me. I believe that by doing so, I will consequently, uplift and
                    create positive impacts on the world. Whether I'm part of a team, company, or alone, seeing
                    progress is how I obtain satisfaction.
                </p>
